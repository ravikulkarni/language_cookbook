# Generating random numbers

## Java

This can be done using Random class.

```java
Random randomGenerator = new Random();
int randomInt = randomGenerator.nextInt(100);  //This will generate random number between 0 and 100 (excluding 100).
```

In Random class there are functions to generate random numbers for different data type.

## Perl

This can be done using rand function

```perl
rand EXPR
rand
```

Returns a random fractional number greater than or equal to 0 and less than the value of EXPR. (EXPR should be positive.) If EXPR is omitted, the value 1 is used.

To create a random number upto 10 use

```perl
my $randomNumber = int(rand(10));
```

To create a range of random numbers, for example between 5 and 10, use this formula to pass number to rand function and add lower range to it. rand($higherRange - $lowerRange + 1) + $lowerRange

```perl
my $randomNumver = int(rand(10-5+1)) + 5;
```

## C

A random number can be generated by using rand function which generates random number between RAND_MAX. RAND_MAX is defined in stdlib differing by implementation but is is usually atleast 32767.

```c
int randomNo = rand();
To make a random number in a range use the function as below
int randomNo = rand() % (highestValue - lowestValue) + lowestValue;
```

## Bash

The randomg number can be generated in Bash using $RANDOM internal function. Below is an way to generate random ranging between $lowest and $highest value. The $RANDOM generates number in range of 0 to 32767.

```bash
newrand=$[ ( $RANDOM % ( $[ $highest - $lowest ] ) ) + $lowest ]
```
