# Writing output to terminal window

## Java
The output stream for the terminal window is in the System class. Writing to the terminal window is done using 
```java System.out.println``` command. There are other versions of print function too in the same ‘out’ output stream. Please refer to the javadoc for OutputStream class

## Perl
The handle for writing the output to terminal window is STDOUT. It is also the default handle. Calling ‘print’ command with no handle will write the contents to the terminal window.

## Bash
“echo” command is used to write the contents to the terminal window.

## C
Using printf command writes the contents to the terminal window. Please refer to printf command documentation to see the specifiers.
